# NonlinearContinua

`NonlinearContinua.jl` is the core interface for the definitions used in the TRACER Lab Continuum Modeling suite. This module defines a core interface between different energy domains and methods. The aim is to provide a standard interface for predicting material behavior.

# Nonlinear Continua

This is a meta-package for all child packages dealing with nonlinear continuum scale models. This allows for reuse among packages of the same tensor names and defines a common interface between packages.
